# Privacy Policy

I, **Amal S Raj** built the **Death Tracker of Elden Ring** app as an Ad Supported app. This app is provided by **Amal S Raj** at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my app.

If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. No information is being sent back to me, while you use the app. The only information that is being saved to your own phone is the data regarding the bosses and their death count that you provide yourself.


## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.
